# OrderFlow

**OrderFlow** is a microservice-based order management system built with **.NET 8**, **Docker**, and **RabbitMQ** using **event-driven architecture** principles. It is designed as a hands-on learning project for practicing microservices, clean architecture, message-driven communication, relational databases, and containerized development workflows.

---

## üß† Project Overview

OrderFlow is composed of independently deployable services that communicate through RabbitMQ events. Each microservice handles a dedicated business capability. So far, the project includes:

### üßæ OrderService

- Handles order creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- Persists order data in a local SQLite database.
- Publishes `OrderCreated` events to RabbitMQ when an order is successfully created.

### üì¶ ProductService

- Manages products, including name, price, and stock.
- Persists product data in a local SQLite database.
- Will soon subscribe to `OrderCreated` events to update stock (event-driven consumer coming soon).

Future plans include:

- PaymentService for processing payments
- InventoryService for more advanced stock management
- NotificationService to alert users

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The services and dependencies run with Docker Compose. Each service exposes its own HTTP API:

| Service        | URL                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| OrderService   | http://localhost:5064  |
| ProductService | http://localhost:5070  |
| RabbitMQ (UI)  | http://localhost:15672 |
