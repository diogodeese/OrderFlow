# OrderFlow

**OrderFlow** is a microservice-based order management system built with **.NET 8**, **Docker**, and **event-driven architecture** principles. It is designed as a learning project to practice microservices, clean architecture, message brokers, relational databases, and containerized development workflows.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

OrderFlow is composed of independently deployable services that communicate through events (planned: via RabbitMQ). Each service is responsible for a specific business capability, starting with:

- `OrderService`: Handles creation and retrieval of customer orders.

This project is intended for learning purposes and will evolve to include more services such as PaymentService, InventoryService, and NotificationService.
